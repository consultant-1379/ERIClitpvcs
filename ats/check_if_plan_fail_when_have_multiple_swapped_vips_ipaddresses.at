# This AT is for development testing
#
# Goal: check if fail to create a plan when swapping
#       multiple existing VIP ipaddresses to
#       another VIP in the same vcs_clustered_service.
#
# Scenario:
#       Inherited from cluster_common_with_vips.atlib
#
# Actions:
#       Update VIPs ipaddresses swapping multiple
#       existing ones in the same vcs_clustered_service
#       'PL_cups'.
