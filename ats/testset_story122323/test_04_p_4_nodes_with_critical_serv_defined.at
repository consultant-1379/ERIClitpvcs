# TORF- 122323 - As an ENM user I want to allow a service to be identified as critical when there is more than
# 2 nodes in the cluster so that I can have a 4 node cluster
#
#	test_04_p_4_nodes_with_critical_serv_defined
#		Description: Test to verify that at initial install the model can have 4 nodes, and define a FO CS
#		that is a critical service on the cluster
#		Steps: 1. Define a FO service group in the litp model with 4 nodes
#			   2. Update FO service group to be a critical service
#			   3. Create/ Run Plan
#			   4. Assert no Errors are raised
#
#		Expected Result: Test will pass without any assertions raised
#
runLitpScript ../testset_common/cluster_common_four_node.atlib

# Step 1: Define a FO service group in the litp model with 4 nodes
litp create -t service -p /software/services/mock -o service_name='mocklsb'
litp create -t vcs-clustered-service -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/services/cs1 -o name="cs1" standby=1 active=1 node_list="node_1,node_2"
litp inherit -s /software/services/mock -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/services/cs1/applications/mock

# Step 2: Update FO service group to be a critical service
litp update -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/ -o critical_service="cs1"

# Step 3: Create/ Run Plan
litp create_plan

# Step 4: No Errors returned
