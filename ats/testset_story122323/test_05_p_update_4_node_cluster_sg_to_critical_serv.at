# TORF- 122323 - As an ENM user I want to allow a service to be identified as critical when there is more than
# 2 nodes in the cluster so that I can have a 4 node cluster
#
#	test_05_p_update_4_node_cluster_sg_to_critical_serv
#		Description: Test to verify that a user can update their sg to critical service on a 4 node cluster
#
#		Steps: 1. Define a FO service group in the litp model with 4 nodes
#			   2. Create/ Run Plan
#			   3. Update node count on cluster with a critical service
# 			   4. Assert no errors are returned
#		Expected Result: Test will pass without any assertions raised

# Step 1: Define a FO service group in the litp model with 4 nodes
litp create -t service -p /software/services/mock -o service_name='mocklsb'
litp create -t vcs-clustered-service -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/services/cs1 -o name="cs1" standby=1 active=1 node_list="node_1,node_2"
litp inherit -s /software/services/mock -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/services/cs1/applications/mock

# Step 2: Create/ Run Plan
litp create_plan
litp run_plan

# Step 3: Update node_list on fo sg to be a critical service
litp update -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/ -o critical_service="cs1"

# Step 4: Assert No errors returned, other than no tasks generated
assertError --err_type DoNothingPlanError --err_message 'Create plan failed: no tasks were generated' create_plan
