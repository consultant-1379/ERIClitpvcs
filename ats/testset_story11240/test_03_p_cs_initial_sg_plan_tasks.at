# test_03_p_cs_initial_sg_plan_tasks.at

# Description:
#
# When cs_initial_online property is set to on, then the litp plan will contain tasks to online the service group.
# Should the property be set to off, then the litp plan will not contain any tasks to online the service group.
#
# Test Steps:
#
# 1. Execute a litp update command on the vcs-cluster model item, setting the cs_initial_online property to off.
# 2. Execute a litp create command to create a new clustered service item
# 3. Execute a litp create_plan command
# 4. Assert the show_plan result does contain tasks to configure the service group
# 5. Assert the show_plan result does not contain any tasks to online the service group
# 6. Execute a litp update command on the vcs-cluster model item, setting the cs_initial_online property to on
# 7. Execute a litp create_plan command
# 8. Assert the show_plan result does contain tasks to online the service group
#
# Expected Result:
#
# The litp plan will configure the clustered service but will not bring it online unless cs_initial_online value is set to on.

# Prerequisite - LITP Deployment

# 1. Execute a litp update command on the vcs-cluster model item, setting the cs_initial_online property to off

# 2. Execute a litp create command to create a new clustered service item
litp create -t service -p /software/services/mock -o service_name=mocklsb

litp inherit -s /software/services/mock -p /deployments/test/clusters/cluster1/services/cs1/applications/mock

# 3. Execute a litp create_plan command
litp create_plan

# 4. Assert the show_plan result does contain tasks to configure the service group
