# test_02_n_no_model_update_cs_initial_no_generate_plan.at

# Description:
#
# When the new property, cs_initial_online, is updated and there are no changes in the model that would generate plan tasks, the property update is ignored.
#
# Test Steps:
#
# 1. Execute a litp update command on the vcs-cluster model item, setting the cs_initial_online property value to off.
# 2. Assert a DoNothingPlanErrorwhen litp create_plan command is executed
#
# Expected Result:
#
# Property cs_initial_online is ignored on create_plan if no changes exist in the model as the vcs-clustered-service is in an applied state after the plan is run.

# Prerequisite - LITP Deployment
# # From cluster_common.atlib /w modified create cluster
